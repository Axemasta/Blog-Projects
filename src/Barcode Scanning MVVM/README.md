## Nuget Packages

This project uses the following NuGet Packages...

_due to an Android bug with ZXing Mobile 2.4.1, you may find that the android version does not scan. If you encounter this issue, try restoring the NuGet packages and if that fails try downgrading the Zxing.Mobile & Zxing.Mobile.Form packages in the android project to 2.3.2_
